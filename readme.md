## Flashcards

### App Description
`TODO://` This is the optional. I did only the first two optionals, but I'm still working on this. I'm trying to add haptic feedback to the green button (for when the user gets the flashcard right) on the bottom right. The 'Next' button at the top of the screen is just a temp button until I figure out how to use the swift dictionary to switch the flashcard labels.
